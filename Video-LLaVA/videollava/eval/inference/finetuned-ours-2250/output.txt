Response: The video is funny because the child is pretending to read a book while holding a remote control, which is an unconventional and humorous combination of objects. The child's actions are also amusing because they are not following the typical rules of reading, such as holding the book in the correct position or turning the pages in the correct order. Additionally, the child's facial expressions and body language add to the humor, as they appear to be enjoying themselves and having fun while pretending to read.
